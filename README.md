# MenuMaster

MenuMaster is a modern, interactive menu filtering application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to view food items and filter them by different categories such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Shakes, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup structure for building the page layout.
- **CSS**: Styling and responsiveness of the page elements.
- **JavaScript**: Used for interactive elements, filtering, and handling user events.

## Features

- **Interactive Filtering**: Filters the menu items dynamically based on category selection.
- **Dynamic Content**: The menu is updated and displayed based on data, ensuring scalability and easy maintenance.
- **Responsive Design**: The design is responsive, ensuring that the menu works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

1. **DOMContentLoaded**: The application initializes when the DOM is fully loaded. It fetches the menu data and displays all items initially.
2. **Filter Buttons**: The application creates filter buttons dynamically based on the categories in the menu.
3. **Event Handling**: When a user clicks a filter button, the page content is updated to show only the items of the selected category.
4. **Reusability**: The code is designed with reusability in mind, with separate functions for displaying menu items and filter buttons.
